ML prediction stock market index

Based on scientific paper "How effective is machine learning in stock market predictions?" 
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024001543
I have builed a ML ANN model with Python to predict DAX PERFORMANCE-INDEX (^GDAXI) 

The model'sparameters are :

neuroni_per_livello = 50
numero_livelli_nascosti = 2
funzione_attivazione = 'relu'
dropout_rate = 0.2
learning_rate = 0.001
epoche = 50
batch_size = 32
